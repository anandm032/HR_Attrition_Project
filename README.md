ðŸ“Š HR Attrition Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand the key reasons behind employee attrition and predict future resignations. 
Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), I performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and built machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, achieving up to 98% accuracy. 
SHAP analysis was used to explain model predictions, and the insights were visualized through a professional Power BI dashboard highlighting trends like department-wise attrition, salary impact, promotions, and overtime.
The project also includes a concise report and actionable suggestions in PDF format to help HR teams improve employee retention.
